# BrickBreakerGame
A simple game developed by me for -IT214- course project and supervised by T.Meshaiel Alshuail, 
I developed this game using Java programming language. 
This game has simple rules ; 
1- Break all the bricks.
2- Try to prevent the ball from falling.
and it is fully controlled by the keyboard.


# How the game works?
It is a paddle and ball, the player must prevent the ball from falling
at the begginig the speed of the ball will be medium, but when the player wins
the number of bricks will increase and also the speed will increase as well -New levels-.
If the player lost, the game will restart again with the first level.

# Concepts I used
I used inheritance for class, implementation for interfaces and a whole GUI.
